            <hr>
            <p class="mt-4"> This snake game was used drawing a canvas and required local storage
                to keep track of the score. The inspiration behind doing this was because of the old nokia phone that had the
                original snake game on it.
                The game itself is not too complex, have the snake eat the food to grow bigger and fill up the canvas to win.
            </p>

            <p> The lose conditions were set to if the snake ate itself or hit the walls of the board. </p>

            <img src="../assets/movekeys.png">
            <p> The controls for the snake itself are using the arrow keys on the user's keyboard. The buttons on the keyboard are assigned in javascript with key codes. 
            The buttons themselves wouldn't have much of a use if it didn't move anything, so had to make a condition where if the button was pressed, it would go in the direction of the x or y axis according
            to left or right, up and down. </p>
